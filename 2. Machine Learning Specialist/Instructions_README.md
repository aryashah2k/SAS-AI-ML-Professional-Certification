Important Instructions:

To get the most from this course, it is important to practice the tasks that you learn in the virtual lab.

Note: In this course, the demonstrations and practices build on each other, so you must perform them in the listed order.

Types of Practice in This Course
There are two ways to practice in this course:

Demonstration videos: After you watch the demo video, perform the same demo steps, which are listed in the associated text version below the video. In the demo steps, you build and attempt to improve models manually. The approach involves changing specific properties through trial and error.

Note: The demo step text version pages might occasionally contain notes with supplemental details that are not stated in the corresponding demo video.

Stand-alone optional practices: For each type of model presented in the course, there is an optional practice that has no accompanying demo video. In these practices, you use the Autotune feature to automate the hyperparameter tuning process. Then you compare the results from the manual and autotuned versions of the model.

Note: Autotuning is disabled in SAS Viya for Learners. The software returns an error when a user requests autotuning. The error generated might be a generic error that does not reference autotuning.
Demo Video Updates
Some of the demo videos in this course were updated to reflect new features in SAS Viya. You might notice some minor interface differences between these newer demo videos and those that were not updated. For example, some of the nodes are a different color. However, any remaining differences are incidental.

Results in SAS Viya
Due to the distributed nature of the flexible computing environment on the SAS Viya platform, results from different sessions will be similar but likely not identical. Likewise, the results that you see while working in the software might differ from the results that appear in the course.

Note: This course is not designed to be used with SAS Viya for Learners.

Experimenting with Model Settings
Experimenting with model settings is a standard practice for model building. However, if you choose to go beyond the steps in the practices, make sure to create a separate project in Model Studio for this purpose.

Signing In to SAS Drive and Model Studio
Model Studio is a web-based application that you access using a web browser. SAS Drive is a hub for the SAS Viya applications, including Model Studio. In the virtual lab, the web address to access SAS Drive is saved as a favorite on the Google Chrome toolbar.

From the Windows taskbar, launch Google Chrome. When the browser opens, select SAS Drive from the bookmarks bar or from the link on the page.

If the user ID and password are not pre-filled, do the following:

In the User ID field, enter student.

In the Password field, enter Metadata0.

Note: Use caution when you enter the user ID and password because values can be case sensitive.

Click Sign In.

In the Assumable Groups window, select Yes.

The SAS Drive home page appears. From SAS Drive, you can access SAS Viya products, such as Model Studio.
Note: If your SAS Drive or Model Studio session times out, the Sign in to SAS window appears. Use the same user name and password to sign in.

Saving Your Work
Important: It is highly recommended that you save your virtual lab image at the end of each session because the demonstrations and practices in this course build on each other. If you do not save your virtual lab image, your work will not be preserved for future sessions. In that case, you will need to redo any earlier demonstrations and practices, starting with Lesson 1.

Course Data
The data set that is used in the course demonstrations and practices is in the following location: D:\Workshop\Winsas\CPML.You specify this location only once, when you load the data in the first demonstration. After the data are loaded into memory, you access the data directly from Model Studio.
